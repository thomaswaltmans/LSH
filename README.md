# LSH

File that runs Locality-Sensitive Hashing on a data set of TV models over four different webshops.
In the part "Opening the JSON file" the filepath has to be adjusted for personal use.
The data set used is available from https://personal.eur.nl/frasincar/datasets/TVs-allmerged.zip.
In the "Running the algorithms" part, one can adjust the parameters for n (number of Min-Hashes) and b (number of bands).
Output is the running times of the seperate elements of the code, the total running time and the performance measures of LSH.
